# Google-Apps-Script

I will be adding scripts that I believe is not found elsewhere(that's what I believe) ,anyways the stuff I add is very basic yet I found it hard to find reference for the same,so I just feel some might benefit out of this.

    The CHAR() function (Google sheets built-in function),to which the numerical values(ASCII codes 0:8304) corresponding to superscript of a number is passed as an     arguement,gives the desired corresponding character value (eg:hi<sup>0</sup>).
